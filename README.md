# VM Selection Application

We're building a *virtual machine selection application* for AWS web services.

Our goal is to streamline creation of cloud-based virtual machines so that teammembers can
access the computing horsepower that they need without having to be experts at AWS.

The gh-pages project web site is availble here: <https://vcu-ssg.github.io/ssg-aws-vm-picker>.  The
project website is creating using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and
[GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)

## Folders

*./reports* contains QMD files for the website homepage (index.qmd) and any
other documents. Store all the QMD files here!

*./docs* contains the web site.  This folder is managed by Quarto and files should
be dropped into this folder manually ONLY if you know what you're doing!
